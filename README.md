Daniel Hamadeh's Portfolio of previous work


Folder Content Descriptions:



SQL Examples - 
Contains various examples of stored procedures that I have created during my time working in the field. Each sub-folder within contains stored procedures that were made to be used together at the time of use (each sub-folder were different completed projects). 

Currently all contained stored procedures were created in MSSQL 2016.



Created_Tools_RawFiles -
A work project I solely created in Visual Studio 2018 (named Triad_Tools), this folder contains one of my more recent pieces of professional work. The project includes multiple tools for employees to use at Triad for thier day to day operations. These examples are a small modified piece of the complete project.

Contains a .sln file so that the project may be opened in Visual Studio once unzipped. With this anyone can see the source code as well as the UI that was created within the project.



School Work (Work in progress) - 
Contains various assignments completed during my time at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Assignments include pieces of code, documentation and built programs. This section is currently a work in progress and more will be uploaded. (Some assignments were done with other students)
